# Bomb-Text-game
Overview: Bomb Text is an interactive text-based game where players enter a piece of text, and a randomly selected "bomb" character is hidden within it. The objective is to avoid this bomb character, which, when found, will "explode" the text, truncating it and revealing the remaining characters.
