Game Description: Bomb Text
Overview: Bomb Text is an interactive text-based game where players enter a piece of text, and a randomly selected "bomb" character is hidden within it. The objective is to avoid this bomb character, which, when found, will "explode" the text, truncating it and revealing the remaining characters. The game provides feedback on how much of the text remains after the explosion and calculates a score based on the remaining text.

Gameplay:

Character Selection: The game starts by randomly selecting a bomb character from the alphabet (a-z). This character is kept secret from the player.

Text Input: The player is prompted to enter a piece of text. The input text can be up to 200 characters long.

Bomb Detection: As the game processes the text, it visually indicates progress with arrows (>) and dots (.). The game scans the text character by character to check if the bomb character is present.

Explosion: When the bomb character is found in the text, the game truncates the text at the bomb's location, simulating an "explosion." The remaining text is then displayed, and the game announces the explosion with a "BOOOOOOM" message.

Scoring: The game calculates the percentage of the original text that remains after the explosion. This score is based on the length of the remaining text relative to the original text length. A higher percentage indicates that more of the original text remains intact.

Features:

Random Bomb Character: Each game generates a new random bomb character, adding variability and replayability.
Visual Feedback: The game uses visual cues (arrows and dots) to enhance the playerâ€™s experience.
Score Calculation: The score reflects the percentage of the text that survived the explosion, providing a measure of success.
Example Scenario:

The bomb character chosen is 'e'.
The player enters the text "Hello, World!".
As the game scans the text, it finds 'e' in the word "Hello," truncating the text to "Hell".
The remaining text "Hell" is displayed, and the score is calculated based on the remaining text length.
Objective: The goal is to have as much of the original text remain after the explosion. Players can challenge themselves to avoid the bomb character or simply enjoy the interactive and dynamic nature of the game.
